This post will introduce to you the approach on how to productively deal with disagreements. This approach is taught in many books of personal leadership genre.

First of all, let’s recall that famous business consultant Dale Carnegie said that the best theory of argumentation is to avoid arguing at all when possible. However, what should we do when disagreements inevitably come across us. Personal leadership books have a strong opinion on how to take disagreements.

Before diving into the approach, let’s first talk about disagreements generally. Has it ever happened with you that you confidently disagreed with someone and then changed your mind after some time? Of course, it happens with everyone sometimes. The most common problem here is that sometimes we are too confident to listen to a different opinion because we think we know everything. However, it may turn out that other person knows something we don’t know. This is the problem I’d like to focus on in this post.

Let me demonstrate this problem in Stephen Covey’s example. Please, look at the picture below and think what’s there:

![8-covey-example.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/8-covey-example.png)

What did you see there? Was it an old woman or a young woman? Both of them can be seen in the picture but you probably saw only one of them. So if you just discovered the second interpretation of the picture, then you experienced what Stephen Covey calls a paradigm shift. (a paradigm is someone’s current knowledge and experience) So when you found the second interpretation of the picture, your paradigm improved since you knew both interpretations. The more we know, the better our paradigm is. Sometimes we take our paradigm as an undeniable truth while our paradigm may always be defective actually. We need to always keep it in mind.

Let's imagine the situation when a group of people can’t agree on what is in the picture. While they can be all right, they can still argue for some time. They just need to take a pause to understand each other. The more time they need, the worse they deal with disagreements because they don’t try to listen to other’s opinions and they think their vision is enough and they don’t even try to understand why other people disagree.

Personal leadership books suggest to us to really try to listen to people. Not to show that you listen to them but to truly listen and understand. When the other person sees that you understand him/her, the conversation goes much better. Moreover, you can really get some new information. You just need to be ready to get this new information because as I previously showed, we are sometimes too confident that there is just a lack of knowledge in a different opinion.

I suggest a method to achieve this empathic listening: repeat what the other person thinks while he/she doesn’t say that you understand him/her. I use this method a lot and it really helps win over.

While the approach is quite natural and obvious, many people forget about it. So try to understand other people first before you disagree with them.

Thank you for reading.
