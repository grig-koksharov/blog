title: 3 Reasons to Start Planning Your Life
---

Here I'll be happy to share with you my 3 reasons why you may want to start doing personal planning.

First of all, let me explain what I mean by personal planning here. Personal planning is the process of creating an action plan based on awareness, values, reflection, goal-setting and planning for personal development within the context of career, education, health, relationships, work-life balance or for self-improvement. For example, this plan can be written as lists of your goals for a day, a week, or a month. You can have it in your notebook or in a mobile app for example. Once you write a plan, you constantly update it and check where you are and where you should go.
A personal plan can develop your vision for your future, helping you achieve more from your life – whatever that may be! A personal plan can help you find your dream job, attain your health goals, develop your relationships or simply allow yourself the time to work on yourself. A personal plan supports you on your journey to build a balanced life and engage more with the things you really want to get done. How does a personal plan does so? Let me show it to you describing 3 things you get with personal planning.

1. Proactivity
The first advantage you get is that you start spending your time more proactively. Planning is thinking how you can spend your time better. When you write down your daily goals, first, you formulate your goals. You define what you want to achieve this day. It makes you understand what you need to focus on. Once you know what you should work on, this knowledge will settle in your head. You’ll naturally have your goals in your mind. It’ll make you spend your time more effectively in a natural way. You won’t need to check out your planner every minute for it. For instance, when you have a free minute, it’d more likely that you wouldn’t waste your time staring at phone and, instead, naturally spend this minute productively and proactively. Of course it’s not guaranteed that you’ll do everything you’ve written down to your planner. However, it’s really more likely that you’ll spend more time proactively since you defined what proactivity actually is for you in scope of this day or week or the period you have plans for. We sometimes forget about our personal development, while planning reminds us about it. Planning reminds us about not urgent but important things. It makes us think about tomorrow.

2. Self-assessment
The second advantage is that you can measure how you improve.
Sometimes we forget to think how fast we move towards our goals. We may have our goals defined but we may do nothing to achieve them. We may know what we want and we may know how to achieve that, but surprisingly we still may not work on it. However, planning makes us realise it and planning reminds us about it. Planning points out how well we make progress towards our goals.
With planning, you see how well you do throughout the week. In the end of the week you’ll have a chance to compare expectation and reality. Your results are lists of goals and marks whether you achieved them or not. Exploring them may give you some idea of how you need to change your performance or unrealistic expectations. You’ll be able to measure your success of the week. Self-assessment helps you understand where you should work more. It also gives you some idea of how much you usually accomplish.

3. Self-discipline
The last thing I’d like to talk about is self-discipline. Planning is about organising your life and taking it under control. The more you plan, the more you take control of your life and develop your self-awareness.
When talking about self-discipline, it’s important to mention that planning trains your willpower as well. For example, when you need to do something you don’t really want to do, it feels different when you have this task written in your planner. You are more concentrated on surpassing your weaknesses. That’s why you’ll probably procrastinate less. Also, when planning your tasks in advance, you can plan something challenging, something that you don’t usually do. Though it’s important to set goals that you’ll be able to cope with.

Summarising, with journaling, you start being more proactive as you think about your future more. You also understand better whether you need to work more on something because you constantly assess your performance. Finally, you boost your self-awareness taking your life under control.

That’s it. I hope I encouraged you a little bit to at least try planning. Thank you very much for reading this.
