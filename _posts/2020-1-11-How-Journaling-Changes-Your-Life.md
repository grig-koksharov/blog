title: How Journaling Changes Your Life
---

This post is to discuss what journaling is and how it works with examples from my own experience.

## What is journaling

So journaling is the process of recording your experiences and thoughts on personal topics. There are no strict rules what exactly journal should consist of. It's kind of art where you yourself define how your journal will look and what it will be about. Your journal can be either a simple notebook or audio files. You can even draw pictures instead of writing. You can do it daily or weekly, or whenever you like. Although I'd separate journaling from personal planning where you are focused on tracking your goals. Instead, the feature of journaling is your personal insights. Let me describe my journal for example.

## My journal

My own journal is actually the same notebook where I do personal planning. I'm trying to journal my life daily. I've been journaling my days for more than a year. Everyday I shortly describe my main impressions from the day and what happened. I often draw funny childish pictures there. The pictures describe some impressions or situations during the day as well. It makes my journal much brighter.
I have one more notebook where I rarer write bigger notes. These notes usually describe my thoughts on some personal topics and work problems.

## 3 advantages of journaling

You can benefit from journaling in numerous different ways, but I'd like to share with you those 3 that I experienced most.

#### Self-awareness

The first benefit of journaling I'd like to mention is that with journaling you develop your self-awareness a lot. Haven't you ever had difficulties answering the question what did you do yesterday? I've personally had. We can be so easygoing and careless that we can stop noticing simple happy moments in our lives. We can work too hard and concentrate on something too much so that we forget about everything else.  Journaling makes us think more about such moments. It helps you realise what's happening in your life besides things you pay attention to most.
Furthermore, journaling also helps formulate your opinion on topics you're concerned about. Journaling gives you unlimited time to structure your thought. It's easier to shape your thoughts in a journal because you can stop writing for a moment and your thought still will not be lost and you will be able to continue writing from the same point of your thought later. It's still very useful even when you stop writing for only a minute or less. You also have a lot of time to choose right words. I remember how journaling helped me a lot in this way. I was absorbed in some personal problem. In spite of the fact I was so absorbed in it, I realised once that I don't have a strong opinion about it. Therefore I decided to shape my insights on the paper. This process helped me understand better my own opinion when I structured it in my journal. That's how self-awareness is boosted by journaling.

#### Stress Management

Journaling is a great stress management tool. Various studies showed that journaling is an amazing way to cope with stress. It helps you gain control under emotions and improves mental health. It lets you pour out emotions in such a quiet way. When you're frustrated, you can write down whatever comes to your mind. Then you'll probably have feeling like if you complained to someone. It makes you relief. I remember how I experienced it when I was so under emotions that I was ready for some drastic, incorrigible decisions. However, when I put my emotions on the paper, I relieved a lot and I changed my mind. I realise now how I'd regret if I really made this decision. Such situations occurred with me many times. 
I have one more funny example what journaling does with my emotions. As I said earlier, I draw pictures in my own journal. The pictures describe some situations or my impressions. When I draw some happy moments, I automatically smile. When what I draw frustrates me, I automatically frown. It was funny to notice how my face expression automatically changes. Once I finish my picture or writing, I feel like I poured out my emotions.

#### Personal History

Finally, your journal is a story of your life. It’s great when you can see how you changed and what your old days looked like. I often flip through the old pages feeling nostalgic about those days. It’s amazing.

## Summary

In short, journaling stimulates your self-awareness, improves your mental health and, lastly, it’s resulted in recorded parts of your life that are nice to recall in future. These points make journaling super cool.
