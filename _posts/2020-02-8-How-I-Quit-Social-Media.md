## What made me quit

A year has already passed since I quit social media. At that moment, I could spend about half an hour a day on Instagram and a Facebook alternative (vk.com). It’s about 15 hours a month wasted. I was subscribed to people I didn’t care about. Also, I realized that it’d be much better to talk with my friends instead of watching them there. Moreover, I didn’t just check there my friends and relatives but I spent much time looking at “funny” videos and break-dance content. Even though break-dance is my hobby, these videos didn’t bring me any benefits. However, the amount of wasted time was significant as you could notice. I could’ve spent this time much better. Understanding all this information made me quit social media at some point.

## How difficult was it

I had been using social media for a long when I decided to quit. It had already become a habit to spend a lot of my free time there. For example, I was used to check Instagram when I woke up or while I was traveling by subway. So I was struggling a lot with these habits at first.

Social media gives an opportunity to fulfill your social needs. However, you may notice that there are better ways for this and it even could be a reason why you want to quit. So when I quit social media, I felt a lack of social interactions even though I started to communicate with my friends and relatives better.

I was used to communicating with my friends in social media apps. Since I removed them from my phone, instead, I installed messengers apps to keep in touch with my friends. It was also one of the things I had to change.

## Positives

I started to live a more real life. Earlier, when I was traveling, I was focused on what photos I could make. I was thinking more about what other people think about me. Once I quit social media, I was more concentrated on my feelings and impressions.

Once I quit social media, I noticed that I spent more time useful. Instead of social media, I spent many hours in educational mobile applications. I learned German in Duolingo app and I explored the world map in Geography app.

Another positive point is that less unimportant people left in my life. I devoted more time to real friends and family.

## Negatives

On the other hand, I still didn’t spend all the replaced time more usefully. For example, I started to watch a lot of break-dance videos on YouTube.

It often happened that my friends lost me and they missed some important news in my life. I often missed their important news as well.

## Summary

Unfortunately, I didn’t start spending all of those 15 hours a month on online courses, books, etc. Moreover, sometimes I forgot to support relationship with my friends and family since I wasn’t reminded about them on Instagram. So it wasn’t that perfect how I could imagine before. However, I think it was a super positive change in my life I would recommend to anyone.
