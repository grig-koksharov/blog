title: 7 Self-Improvement Ideas
---
Hey, let me share with you some of my simple ideas for self-development.

### Learning a new language
I recently learned some German using the mobile app Duolingo. It's a cool exercise for brains. Also, you will probably find the language useful in some situations. Besides that, you may find it interesting to explore the culture along with learning the language.

### Geography
Since I had problems with recognizing countries locations on the map, it was cool to me to explore the world map in a mobile app "Geography". It's useful because when you poorly know the countries locations, it may be difficult to keep some politics/travel conversations going.

### Philosophy
I found philosophy online courses amazing at helping you better define your life position. I'd very recommend learning philosophy to anyone who doesn't have a strong worldview. Of course, philosophy doesn't answer the questions, but it formulates them and it shows how other people answer them. It helps you understand your own answers.

### History
I just finished a huge amazing audiobook called "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind". It was super inspiring. History introduces other cultures. It shows you the problems people came across over history. It gives you new ideas.

### Sport exercises daily
Just to feel better, I'd recommend you to do some light sport exercises every day. Especially if you work in the office like me. For example, when I started to do pull-ups, my back felt much better.

### Psychology
With psychology books, you can better understand other people and even yourself. It makes you much more efficient in communicating with others.

### Classic literature
Classic literature is important because it opens up a perspective to different worlds and historical perspectives. Reading classic novels also improves your overall vocabulary and writing skills. We all were supposed to read it in school but if you were a bad pupil like me then you may also want to fill in the gaps now.

### Professional courses/books
Professional books and online courses open new doors in your career. I actually found my first job with 10 online courses in my resume. Professional books and online courses still keep teaching me now.
