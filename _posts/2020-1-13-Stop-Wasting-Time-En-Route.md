title: Stop Wasting Time En Route
---

How much time do you waste en route to work or school? What if you spend this time usefully? Let's discuss how we can change the situation.

It's sad to realise how much time we wasted and how we could spend it better. It's inescapable that we have to do many simple things that unfortunately take much time. For example washing dishes, ironing, cleaning and so on. And of course, traveling to work or school. Imagine how much you could improve if you spend this time on self-improvement. If you have two 15-minutes trips every workday and if you find some way to spend just 10 minutes of a trip usefully, then you'll win about 7 hours a month. Sounds amazing. Let's now jump into thinking how exactly we can spend this time better.

## Car / bike

#### Audio

It's a pity that when you travel by a car or a bike, your hands are quite busy and there is no way to hold a book. Although I've seen a taxi driver who reads a book while waiting for a green traffic light, but I wouldn't ever do it myself or recommend it to anyone... At least our ears are free. So what you can do is listening to something. You can listen to online courses, audio books, educational videos. It's strange to me now that I didn't consider audio books some time ago. However, now I listen to them a lot. Maybe you also didn't seriously think about listening to them?

#### Phone calls

We may sometimes forget to maintain relationships with people that are important to us. Or we can simple have no time to keep in touch with them. Therefore another thing you can do is to call to your parents or to anyone you want to maintain relationships with. A cool point here is that it doesn't take much energy comparing with reading or listening to educational resources.

#### Devote time to think

Have you ever come across a problem that you don't have enough time for simply thinking about something? For example, you may want to deeply think about your values while you just can't find time for this activity. If it happens with you sometimes, it may make sense to create a rule to forget about everything except this en route to work.

## Subway / taxi

#### Reading

When you travel by subway or taxi, you have more opportunities. Your hands are free to hold a mobile phone or a book. Let's not succumb to temptation to waste your time in social media. Instead, we can read books, news or articles.

#### Mobile apps

There is a plenty of educational mobile apps you can start using. Some examples: learning languages, studying geography, programming problems.

## Exceptions

It's understandable that we are too tired sometimes for activities like above. In this case, we shouldn't hesitate to relax and listen to music. We just should be honest with ourselves that we don't unreasonably waste too much time on social media.

## My experience
I personally tried everything I suggested to you above. I love listening to audio books while driving or washing dishes. Most of books I read are read by me in subway. My favourite educational mobile apps are Coursera, Duolingo, StudyGe, Bookmate. I spent many hours on each of them. I'm also used to call to my parents while driving.

## Summary
Let's spend our time as productively as possible. When you next time go to work, think if you can apply something suggested here. Thank you for reading.
