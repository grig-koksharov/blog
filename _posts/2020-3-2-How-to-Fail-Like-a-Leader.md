Here we share with you the approach on how personal leadership literature advices to take failures.
<!--more-->

You'll probably agree with me that anyone fails a lot. Even all successful people truly failed at some point. However, it's important how you deal with failures and what you take from them. This is the thing that distinguishes leadership behavior from unsuccessful behavior. This is the thing which is discussed in plenty of personal leadership books and the same advice is given everywhere. This post will share with you this advice.

Here are some examples of where you could fail:
- Job interview
- Exams
- Changing your profession
- Relationships
- Startup
- Contest
- Learning something
- Many more

First, let me describe the worst case of how you can deal with failures. Have you seen people that say that they had a dream/goal and they tried to achieve it once but they stopped trying when they failed? Such people are usually very pessimistic and they give you various reasons why they would fail again. Such people just don't try to achieve their dreams at all because they are so afraid of failures. They even forget the idea of moving forward to their dream life. They just don't consider taking any risks to achieve a better life. They give up. 

Hopefully, it's not your case since you at least found time and motivation to read this post. However, we all more or less tend to give up when coming across failures. Let's now speak about how personal leadership books suggest us to take failures.

So instead of just giving up, we should take as much as possible from this negative experience and then we should go on to the next challenges. We shouldn't stop trying, but we should move on with the improved experience. Let's better think about our failures as about opportunities to become better and to learn from that negative experience. Some people say that you learn the best from your own mistakes. That's exactly what the advice points out to.

Another important thing is that sometimes people can't admit their own mistakes. They think like they don't fail at all while they evidently do. Such behavior is obviously still worse than admitting your failure and improving your experience based on it. Repeating the same mistake twice is awful. It's much better to accept the mistake and to soak up the knowledge like a sponge to not step on a rake.

The advice is pretty obvious and simple, isn't it? It is. Like the majority of ideas in personal leadership literature. However, you may notice how many people don't follow these ideas. Just imagine what if all people always approach failures like that? Then everyone would win over some day. However, we see how people forget to follow this obvious idea and they give up. Let's not be like that. Let's own our lives and be leaders.

Thank you for reading.
