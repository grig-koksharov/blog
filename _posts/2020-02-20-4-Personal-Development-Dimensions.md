Here I'd like to introduce to you 4 personal development dimensions defined by Stephen Covey.

Stephen Covey is the author of the book "7 Habits of Highly Effective People" where he mentioned this concept of 4 personal growth dimensions: physical, spiritual, mental, social/emotional. The concept is that we need to constantly balance our personal development across these dimensions.

Covey actually explains this concept only at the end of the book when you are supposed to be familiar with the rest of the book. For example, he says that we have to be proactive to apply this concept. That's really true because not proactive people just don't schedule personal development at all so that there is nothing to balance across these dimensions. However, let me introduce to you this concept anyway since you may be proactive enough without reading the rest of the book.

So the idea is that we do personal development in the right direction only when we remember and take into account all these 4 dimensions. Moreover, these 4 dimensions are interconnected and synergize each other. For instance, if we feel good physically, we have mental clarity and better control of our emotions. Accordingly, if our social life is good, we’ll have more motivation and energy to take care of ourselves physically.

Let's discuss each dimension and how we can move forward within them.

## Physical
Sharpening the blade of physicality ensures your body has the strength and vigor it needs to take on life’s demands. If you’re tired and sick all the time, you’re not going to be very productive, no matter how much you work. Make taking care of your body a priority in your life. Some specific examples of what you can focus on:
* Sport
* Healthy food
* Good sleep
* Cold showers

## Spiritual
The spiritual domain generates your sense of purpose in life. It’s the core of who you are and why you do what you do. Failure to sharpen this blade can leave you feeling cynical, listless, and burned out.
How do you train your soul? Through habits and spiritual disciplines like:
* Study scripture/philosophy
* Practice self-examination
* Attend religious services
* Spend time in silence and solitude
* Cultivate gratitude
* Fast from food
* Spend time in nature
* Work on your mission statement
* Journal

## Mental
For most workers in the modern economy, the job they do is largely “mind work.” It constantly dulls their mental saw, so that doing more mental work in their leisure time — even in the form of “sharpening” — hardly seems like it will be refreshing. They just want to turn their mind off altogether, by surfing the internet or watching TV. This is to say that the best way to rejuvenate your dulled-down mind is not to turn it off, but to give it something different to think about than what it usually grinds through at work. Not only will this fresh mental fare stimulate unused parts of your brain, it can give you insights and ideas that can loop back into your professional success.

So these are specific examples of how you can fuel your brain’s recovery and sharpen the mental blade:

* Read the Great Books
* Write a position paper on a topic of your choosing
* Listen to a stimulating podcast
* Listen to a Great Courses course
* Take an online course
* Attend a lecture at a local college
* Join a discussion group (synergizing mental and social domains!)
* Visit a museum
* Watch a documentary

## Social/Emotional
We are social animals. While it’s true some of us are introverts, even introverts benefit from rubbing shoulders with other human beings. Several studies have found socializing can help reduce stress and curb depressive feelings. What’s more, interacting with other human minds is a way to learn new ideas and refine our own. Socializing synergizes with sharpening our mental blade.
A few suggestions on sharpening the social saw:
* Go out to lunch with a friend
* Write a letter to a loved one
* Make new friends
* Join a sports team
* Take a ruck with some buds
* Dump toxic people from your life
* Eat dinner with your family
* Take your significant other on a date
* Host a dinner party
* Host a poker night

So keep in mind these 4 dimensions. However, remember that when you are not proactive, there is no personal development to balance across these dimensions. So put proactivity first.

Thank you for reading.
