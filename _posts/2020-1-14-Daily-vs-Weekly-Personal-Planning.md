title: Daily vs Weekly Personal Planning
---

Is it more useful to plan daily or to plan weekly? How does the frequency of planning affect your productivity? What about for how long you plan? Let’s ponder these questions a little bit.

Any kind of personal planning is already cool. It boosts your productivity and helps you achieve your goals. However, planning can be different and it’s worth thinking about how to make your planning as efficient as possible. Planning varies in different factors. Some of these factors are the frequency of planning and for how long you plan. That’s what I’d like to focus on here.

## For how long you plan

We all are familiar with a problem when we don’t do important but not urgent things. Those things will make a positive impact on our lives, but still, they are not urgent. For example, jogging, reading, online courses, maintaining relationships. These activities are not urgent because they are long-term and it won’t make any difference if you decide to work on them tomorrow or next week. On the other hand, we know that these activities are in the right direction. Surprisingly, we often procrastinate or simply ignore them.

However, planning reminds us of these important but not urgent goals. Planning helps us realize that it’s the time we need to work on these goals. That’s where it matters for how long your plans are. If you plan for a too short period of time, you are obviously too focused on urgent things. So you are more likely to ignore long-term, not urgent goals. In contrast, when you plan for a long enough time, you take into account long-term goals because you have the capacity to achieve them for this period of time. Therefore the longer you plan for, the more proactive you are in planning.

## Frequency of planning

The more you plan, the more you remind yourself about the goals you should focus on. It’s easy to lose this focus when you plan too rare. If you plan only once a month, you can too quickly forget about your plans next week. Although if you visit your planner from time to time, goals stick to your mind better. It’s much easier to lose concentration on your tasks when you plan weekly comparing with daily planning.

## So how should we plan?

These 2 factors above don’t give an obvious answer whether is’s better to plan daily / weekly / monthly / etc. You can see that it’s better to plan daily from the perspective of how well you focus on planned goals. At the same time, you are not that proactive with daily planning comparing with when you plan monthly, for instance. In other words, if you plan only daily, you’re too into urgent tasks while you’re more likely to ignore not urgent long-term goals.

Therefore the best option is combining different kinds of planning. Plans are just perfect when you plan daily as well as weekly, monthly and yearly. Such personal planning gives amazing results. Although it’s understandable that you may be okay with your current planning efficiency or you may have a lack of time or willpower.

Let’s now leave it up to you what option is best for you. Good luck! Thanks for reading.
